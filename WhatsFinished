What's finished:
CompanyAgent:
1. On setup CompanyAgent sends to VanAgent message with a float that corresponds to it's CompanyEnum
2. CompanyAgent adds VanAgents to VanList if the float value in response == 1
3. CompanyAgent receives PassengerRequest
4. CompanyAgent sends PassengerRequest to VanLists
5. CompanyAgent gathers responses from Vans and adds them to availableVanList
6. CompanyAgent sends //avallableVanList// to Passenger

VanAgent:
1. VanAgent responds with 1 on Companies setup request if it's CompanyEnum equals to the float sent in message, 0 if it's different.
2. VanAgent responds with 1 on PassengerRequest sent by CompanyAgent if it's distanceThreshold is smaller than the difference between it's locationVertex and requested destinationVertex and also between it's locationVertex and requested locationVertex (the passenger's location)
3. Van moves towards destinationVertex every vanMoveDelay seconds, thats initialized by macro INITVANMOVEDELAY
4. When PassengerAgent sends a message to a VanAgent that it is chosen, VanAgent adds Passenger to carriedPassengers conn list, and changes its currentDestinationVertex if RCV.destinationVertex was greater than currentDestinationVertex
